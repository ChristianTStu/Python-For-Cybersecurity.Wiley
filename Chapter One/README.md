# Chapter One: Fullfilling Pre-ATT&CK Objectives

## Description:
Exploring the use of Python for Active Scanning and Search Open Technical Database Techniques 

## MITRE Pre-ATT&CK Matrix: 
- Reconnaissance
- Resource Development

## Sections
- Active Scanning (Scanning Networks with Scapy)
- Impelmentation of SYN Scan in Scapy
- Preforiming a DNS Scan in Scapy
- Network Scanning for Defenders
- Monitoring Traffic with Scapy
- Building Deceptive Responses
- Offensive DNS Exploration
- DNS Lookup
- Reverse DNS Lookup
- Defensive DNS Exploration
- Handling DNS Request
- Building a DNS Response
- Suggested Exercises

## Notable Callouts:
- I needed to download npcap on my computer with "Winpcap compatibility mode" check off during installation mode. This allowed me to start scanning networks. If you are running on Linux you should be able to install libpcap to get this file working. 

## Libraries / Modules Needed:
- Scapy
- Npcap(Windows), Libpcap(Linux)
