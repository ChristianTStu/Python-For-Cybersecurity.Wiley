# Python-For-Cybersecurity.Wiley

## Description:
A walkthrough and creation of all the code provided in Python for Cybersecurity by Howard E. Poston III and Wiley Publishing. Each folder will be one chapter in the book and contain all the code that is discussed in that chapter. All code will be based out of the book but will be written by me. I am using a print edition of the text, so no copying and pasting. All libraries used will be listed below at the completion of the project. This book goes through the entire MITRE Pre-ATT&CK Matrix with essentially one chapter per section of the matrix. Each section of that matrix will be called out in the chapters seperate readme file. 

## Libraries Used:
